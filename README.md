# What is this?
Its Psych Engine 0.5.2h with Kade Engine 1.5.3 Input

Might add a little bit of tweaking to the engine itself

There are memory issues with input, dunno what to do but here is it lol

(No, it doesn't use KE timings, only Input `keyShit`, it uses the same timings as 0.5.2h)

Also you might get the "two_keys" achievement even though you pressed all keys prob, achievements are kinda broken ngl (only that one I hope)
